A simple React web application that acts as a board of sticky notes for writing down your ideas or todo's :) 

I tend to always have about a billion random things that I need to remember to do (that I don't want to do in that moment, cause procrastination) so I need a quick and easy (and permanent) way to write them down.

Backend uses PostreSQL DB + Express 

Current usage:
- Open two separate terminals
- In term1, run node backend/server.js to start the server
- In term2, run npm run start to start the app
