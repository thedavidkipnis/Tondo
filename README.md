A React web application that acts as a board of sticky notes for writing down your ideas or todo's :)

I tend to always have about a billion random things that I need to remember to do (that I don't want to do in that moment, cause procrastination) so I need a quick and easy (and permanent) way to write them down.

Backend uses PostreSQL DB + Express 

This is a WIP! To use in current state:
- Clone https://github.com/thedavidkipnis/Tondo.git
- Open cmd, and cd into the repo you cloned to
- Run 'npm install' to install node_modules locally and grab the right dependencies
- Run 'npm run start' - the project will open in a local browser

If 'npm' doesn't work for you, or throws 'command not found' errors, please refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31472755/sudo-npm-command-not-found) link!
