A React web application that acts as a board of sticky notes for writing down your ideas or todo's :)

I tend to always have about a billion random things that I need to remember to do (that I don't want to do in that moment, cause procrastination) so I need a quick and easy (and permanent) way to write them down.

Currently works with local storage, so just go to the link and all notes should be saved in your browser until you clear them manually.

This is a WIP! Future work:
- Switch to Firebase for data storage and retreival + auth
- Note resizing
- Note moving
