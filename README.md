A React web application that acts as a board of sticky notes for writing down your ideas or todo's :)

I tend to always have about a billion random things that I need to remember to do (that I don't want to do in that moment, cause procrastination) so I need a quick and easy (and permanent) way to write them down.

Currently works with local storage, so just go to the link and all notes should be saved on your machine until you clear them manually.

Future work:
- Undo/Ctrl + z stack
- Support for resizable windows (notes that were previously created on a bigger screen get cut off when the page is loaded on a smaller screen)

This is a WIP! To use in current state:
- Clone https://github.com/thedavidkipnis/Tondo.git
- Open cmd, and cd into the repo you cloned to
- Run 'npm install' to install node_modules locally and grab the right dependencies
- Run 'npm run start' - the project will open in a local browser

If 'npm' doesn't work for you, or throws 'command not found' errors, please refer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31472755/sudo-npm-command-not-found) link!
